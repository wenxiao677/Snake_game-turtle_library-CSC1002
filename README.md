# Snake_game-turtle_library-CSC1002
This program uses python to implement a simple snake game with turtle library.

Turtle library was part of the original Logo programming language developed by Wally Feurzeig, Seymour Papert and Cynthia Solomon in 1967. It is is a pre-installed Python library that enables users to create pictures and shapes by providing them with a virtual canvas. The onscreen pen that you use for drawing is called the turtle and this is what gives the library its name (https://realpython.com/beginners-guide-python-turtle/) .
